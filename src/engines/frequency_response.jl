# M1's first concrete engine: a real-time-steppable center-of-inertia aggregate
# frequency-response model (docs/SPEC.md §7.2, §7.4). Built incrementally in the
# M1 code batch; see docs/plans/m1-plan.md.
#
# Key correctness note carried forward from review (see m1-plan.md "Pitfalls"):
#   The "clamp ΔPm to aggregate headroom" requirement MUST be realised as a
#   saturation in the derivative / a solver callback — NOT as post-hoc clamping
#   of the state variable. Clamping a state without touching its derivative
#   corrupts the integration (the integrator keeps accumulating against a value
#   you silently overwrote).
#
# The numerical guard against small adaptive-step overshoot above `headroom` is an
# `isoutofdomain` predicate on the integrator (see `_fr_outofdomain` / `init!`
# below): it *rejects and retries* an offending step, never overwriting the state,
# so it is consistent with the no-post-hoc-clamp rule and rides on top of the
# derivative saturation. During continuous integration it cannot stall, because the
# derivative is already zeroed at the ceiling (`du[2]=0` there ⇒ the solution sits
# at `ΔPm=headroom`, which is `== headroom`, not `> headroom`, so the predicate does
# not fire). The one way `ΔPm` can end up *strictly above* the ceiling is a
# discrete event: a second trip shrinks `headroom` below the current `ΔPm`, which
# would leave every proposed step out-of-domain and collapse `dt` to an abort. So
# `inject!` (below) re-inits the state to the new ceiling at the event boundary —
# a physically justified discrete jump (the tripped unit's governor share vanishes
# with it), NOT a mid-integration post-hoc clamp.
#
# The engine struct + init!/step!/current_state/inject! live at the bottom of this
# file (built in the M1 code batch; see docs/plans/m1-plan.md step 4).

    aggregates(model::SystemModel, online) -> (; H_sys, R_eq, D, Tg, headroom)

Center-of-inertia aggregates for the units in `online`, on the system base
`model.S_base` (docs/SPEC.md §7.2). `online` is any collection of unit ids
(`Symbol`s) that membership-tests with `in` (e.g. a `Set{Symbol}`).

  - `H_sys = Σ Hᵢ·(Sᵢ/S_base)`      — system inertia constant (s), on system base.
  - `1/R_eq = Σ (1/Rᵢ)·(Sᵢ/S_base)` — aggregate droop gain (pu/pu); `R_eq` is its
    reciprocal. With no online units (or no droop) `R_eq = Inf` (zero gain).
  - `headroom = Σ (Pmaxᵢ − P0ᵢ)/S_base` — aggregate up-reserve (pu on S_base);
    the ceiling at which `ΔPm` saturates (the governors can ramp no further).
  - `D`, `Tg` are system-wide constants, passed through from `model`.

Every one of these is recomputed after a `TripGenerator`: a tripped unit takes
its inertia, its droop gain, **and its own headroom** out of the pool. Pure
function of the model and the online set — the engine calls it at `init!` and
again after every trip to refresh its parameter struct.

    FRParams

Mutable parameter block for the frequency-response ODE. Holds the center-of-
inertia aggregates plus the running disturbance imbalance. **Mutable so live
events can change it** (a `TripGenerator` recomputes the aggregates and bumps
`ΔP_dist`) while the integrator keeps the continuous state `(Δω, ΔPm)` — but
every field is concrete (`Float64`), so the RHS hot path stays type-stable
(docs/SPEC.md §4 "Type stability"; m1-plan.md "Pitfalls").

  - `H_sys`   — system inertia (s), on `S_base`.
  - `R_eq`    — aggregate droop (pu/pu); `Inf` ⇒ no droop gain.
  - `D`       — load damping (pu/pu).
  - `Tg`      — governor/turbine lag (s).
  - `ΔP_dist` — persistent power imbalance (pu on `S_base`); a generation trip
                drives it negative (lost generation), so frequency dips.
  - `headroom`— aggregate up-reserve (pu on `S_base`); `ΔPm` saturates here.

    fr_rhs!(du, u, p::FRParams, t)

In-place RHS of the two-state center-of-inertia frequency model (docs/SPEC.md
§7.2). State `u = (Δω, ΔPm)` — per-unit frequency deviation and the governors'
aggregate extra mechanical power (pu on `S_base`). Both are *deviations* from the
pre-disturbance operating point, so the system starts at the origin.

  - Swing:    `dΔω/dt  = (ΔPm − D·Δω + ΔP_dist) / (2·H_sys)`
  - Governor: `dΔPm/dt = (−Δω/R_eq − ΔPm) / Tg`,  **saturated at `headroom`**.

The headroom saturation is realised as a **saturation in the derivative**, not a
post-hoc clamp of the state: when `ΔPm` is already at the ceiling and the governor
term would push it higher, that derivative component is zeroed. This is the
correctness landmine carried forward from review — clamping the *state* while its
derivative still drives upward corrupts the integration (the integrator keeps
accumulating against a value you silently overwrote). Zeroing the *derivative*
also gives **release for free**: once `Δω` recovers and the governor term turns
negative, the condition stops firing and `ΔPm` comes off the ceiling on its own.

  - **Re-init `ΔPm` to the new ceiling** (`u[2] = min(u[2], headroom)`). A trip
    shrinks the aggregate headroom; if `ΔPm` was riding the *old* ceiling it is now
    stranded above the new one, which the `isoutofdomain` guard would reject on

    and is a *discrete jump*, not the forbidden mid-integration post-hoc clamp.

    its cached (now stale, pre-trip) derivative and recomputes the RHS at the new
